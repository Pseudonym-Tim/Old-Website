     Alright, so I've been working on this game for a bit called EXCAVATOR. It's basically an old-school dungeon crawler,
     so it's supposed to be a retro experience. I decided that the controls should be as simplified
     as possible, and that the game runs in windowed mode. 
     <br>
     <br>Since the game is meant to be played in windowed mode, I had the fun idea to just shake the entire game window itself instead of using any typical in-game screenshake.
     I haven't seen very many games responsively shake the game window, especially not during actual gameplay and functioning how I imagined. I thought it'd 
     be pretty neat, so I figured I should at least test it out and see how it actually felt in-game before tossing this weird idea in the trash.
     <br>
     <br>
     Okay, so how do we go about implementing this? Well, the first order of business is obviously: "How exactly do we even change the position of the game window to begin with? Does Unity have some kinda
     quick and easy function in it's API for that?". And yeah, actually, it does. <strong>Display.SetParams</strong> allows you to set the x and y position of a Display's game window...
     <br>
     <br>
     <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/unity-display-params.png" style="width:100%; max-width:100%"/>
     <br>
     Is it performant to call this function for every frame that we want to shake the window? Is it the proper way to do this sorta thing? No idea! Either way, knowing that it's that easy kinda ruined the fun for me, 
      so naturally I figured I'd make my life way harder by importing some Windows API functions and using those instead. At least then I'm actually
      doing things the "correct" way and it should be pretty optimized. 
      <br>
      <br><strong>user32.dll</strong> can be imported
      using the <strong>System.Runtime.InteropServices</strong> namespace, so you
      can access it's many user interface related functions for the operating system, which, you guessed it, includes window handling stuff.
       The only functions we need are <strong>FindWindow, MoveWindow, and GetWindowRect</strong>. Oh yeah, and we'll want a <strong>RECT</strong> struct. I went ahead and just slapped
       all the stuff I need in it's own static class inside of <strong>WindowShaker.cs</strong>:
       <br>
       <br>
       <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/window-stuff-class.png" style="width:100%; max-width:80%"/>
       <br>
      Alright, so now that we imported those functions, we can use them to actually move the game window now! 
      First we need to find and store the pointer for the game window, plus store some more info that we'll be using, we can just do this on <strong>Awake()</strong> like so:
      <br>
      <br>
      <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/awake.png" style="width:100%; max-width:80%"/>
      <br>
      <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/setup-window-info.png" style="width:100%; max-width:70%"/>
      <br>
      Now that we stored the pointer for the game window and set up some window info, in our main Shake function, we can just do some calculations
      for the shake that frame and then pass our parameters into <strong>MoveWindow</strong>...
      <br>
      <br>
      <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/shake-func.png" style="width:100%; max-width:90%"/>
      <br>
      And voil√†! it works! It shakes with a specified intensity and for a certain amount of time, then returns back to
      it's original position! <br>Here's some (very old) gameplay test footage of EXCAVATOR to show you how the final effect looks:

      <br>
      Shaking the Unity game window initially caused the in-game framerate to drop, causing unplayable stutter! At first I thought
      <strong>MoveWindow</strong> was just not optimized enough to be called every frame, or it was something that I was doing wrong. It turned out that it was just some really weird quirk!
      After tearing all of my hair out and becoming completely bald, I came across a tickbox in the project settings labeled: "Use DXGI flip model swapchain for D3D11". 
      <br>
      <br>
      <img class="croppedImage centerImage" src="/Website/img/blog/blog_(11-13-2022)/bitblit.png" style="width:100%; max-width:70%"/>
      <br>
      Disabling this fixed the issue and made the window shake as smooth as butter! Why? I have no idea! This is supposed to be a performance enhancement for rendering in windowed mode! Weird!
      I seriously doubt anyone on earth has came across this specific problem...
      <br>
      <br>
      Anyway, after testing the window shaking for a while with some various parameters, I decided to keep it as a feature for the game. After the initial implementation,
      I eventually realized that it'd be kinda dumb to FORCE people to play in windowed mode, so I made it to where you can fullscreen the game if you want. 
      I added normal screenshake and now it automatically switches to window shake if you're playing in windowed mode. There's going to be the option
      to just disable window shaking, but I think it will be on by default, along with the game being in windowed mode.
